//1. route handler is code that is looking for a request to a specific incoming URL such as /login and often a specific HTTP verb such as POST and has specific code for handling that precise URL and verb

const router = express.Router(); // Only started route handler

console.log('Router loaded')

router.post('/create_todo',homeController.createTodo) //controller for creating todo list
router.post('/delete_todo',homeController.deleteTodo) // controller for deleting the todo list

//2. Module exports are the instructions that tell Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to export from a given file so that other files are allowed to access the exported code.
